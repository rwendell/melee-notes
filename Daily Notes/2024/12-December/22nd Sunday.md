# Match Notes
## Implementation Goals
- Dash -> Shield
- Run -> Crouch -> Option
- FF from plat
- Waveshine -> Jab
## Analysis
Waveshine to jab really needs some more work. I am able to get the running shine  into wavedash but I keep not getting the jab input. My L-Cancelling can also get kinda lazy, need to work on making sure it's perfect. Especially full-hops onto platforms.  My Ledgedash is starting to become kinda crispy.
