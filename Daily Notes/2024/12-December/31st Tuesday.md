# Match Notes
## Implementation Goals
- FF from plat
- Waveshine -> Jab
- Dash Dance / movement while watching opponent
## Analysis
- full hop drills need to work on l-cancel
- act out of shine practice
- act out of aerial practice
- act out of shield practice
- shine -> up smash practice
### Marth Matchup
Need to work on OOS options, punishing moves.  Can't just run in up smash against good Marth
