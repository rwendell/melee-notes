# Match Notes
## Implementation Goals
- Dash -> Shield
- Run -> Crouch -> Option
- FF from plat
- **Waveshine -> Jab**
## Analysis
Up smash is an offensive tool against aerials (anti-air).  Shield is more defensive.

Waveshine jab can be beaten with overshoot grabs most of the time, the counter to this is shine grab

waveshine jab getting better just need to practice it more
