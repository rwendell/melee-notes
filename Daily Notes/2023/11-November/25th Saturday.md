## Comments
Need to get better muscle memory for shffl late aerial. I will often aerial too early, I don't fast fall my move, or I don't act OOlag fast enough.  These flaws will cause me to get shield grabbed in traditionally safe approaches, which will reinforce bad habits.
# Match Notes
## Goal: Practice Lasering and Proper Late Aerial Approaches (on shield)
## Analysis
Was doing really good at the beginning, but eventually I got a bit tilted and I couldn't stick to the gameplan.  I need to quit out more often if people are spam taunting or being toxic in general. There is no need to play with toxic players. Playing Falco properly is definitely going to tilt people, but I can't get tilted back when they taunt me. If they start spam taunting or doing some other bs, just camp platforms to tilt them even more or play even more passively.
