## Goal: Midlane Melee 105
## Analysis
First time playing Falco in bracket. Didn't win a single pool match, but I won my first silver match. Everything felt pretty solid, but my aerials were coming out too early and my shines weren't coming out.  I need to **slow it down!** I also don't shine grab while I'm in matches.  I need to start using it more often.
