# Match Notes
## Goal: Win a match
## Analysis
I won a game, still no matches won. I was very close and the nerves got to me super hard, but a definite improvement. I feel feel like the game feels different compared to slippi netplay.

acting out of shine still feels weird. I should practice aerial into waveshine to improve this. I think it's because everyone plays so fast that I try to compensate by pushing buttons faster.  if I just slow it down I'll probably have more success.

I definitely found my hands getting more tired towards the end of my sets and I wasn't as focused.  I might try music/white noise to help me lock in next time.
