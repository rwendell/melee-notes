# Shine
Typically used as a "combo move", you don't really use it on it's own.  You usually jump/wavedash/grab etc. out of it. Fox can jump OO Shine frames 4-18.
## Waveshine
combo tool, bread and butter
### Combos
#### Knock Down Characters
##### Jab
Leads into the other options listed below. *must be from running shine*
##### Grab/Up-Smash
Bread & Butter
##### Thunders
Jab into up air
##### Down Tilt
Covers tech in place and missed tech
##### F Tilt
Useful if turned around
#### Slide Characters
##### Waveshine
Not amazing (one shine only does ~4%)
##### Up-Smash
Great Pop-Up
##### Grab
Great for starting a combo
##### Down-Smash & Double Shine
Great at ledges to knock off-stage
## Shine Grab
One of the best shield pressure tools, can only really be beat by opponent shine
### Shine Turnaround Grab
Useful as a mix-up when facing away
## Shine -> Aerial
### Aerial Ranking
1. N-air/D-air
2. B-air/U-air
3. F-Air
### Full Jump
Not as relevant
### Short Hop
More useful frame wise.
*Important Note:* Early aerial can be grabbed after, late aerial can be grabbed before
## JC Shine
### Double/Multi Shine
Cancel your vertical momentum and immediately enter a shine. 
### Up Smash
Great punish for players not expecting it
# OOS
Most universally useful options are shield grab, up-smash, nair, wavedash. Shine/Waveshine have more niche applications.
## Shield-Drop
A tool for instantly dropping from platforms
### Shine
useful for hitting opponents poking below
# Jump
Fox does not have great aerial mobility/control.  In order to control Fox properly you need to decide how to move **before** your jump.
## Types of Jumps
- Dash/Walk/Standstill -> Jump
- Dash/Walk/Standstill  -> Jump -> Forward
- Dash/Walk/Standstill  -> Jump -> Backwards
# Dash Cancel
## Dash (Dashdance)
## Run -> Crouch
Great for setting up options
### shine 
great poke and hard to punish + shine combos
### jab
great for setting up jab Up Smash
### d-tilt
catch people running away
## Wavedash
## Shield
Great for baiting out options and then shield grabbing/up smashing/or wavedash out
### Approaching B-air
you can use shield stop during dash back to create a pseudo pivot approaching b-air
# Recovery
## Firefox
Main Recovery tool
### Tips
- Make sure to hold up forwards after selecting an angle to recover better if they hit you out of firefox
- You should almost always fast fall out of firefox
### Firefox Angles
Learning how to snap to ledge from both sides
### Optimal location to start Up
Typically want to start high and away so you have many options and harder to stuff from stage
# Illusion
## Sweet Spot
## Ledge Cancel
Illusion can be ledge cancelled and become immediately actionable
## Side-B Shorten
Mix up shorten timings to prevent opponents from reading your recovery
# Laser Tech
Not nearly as important as with Falco.  You never really want to do approaching laser because you aren't putting out a hitbox with knockback. One tip while lasering a while, holding shield will prevent standing laser.
## Laser land on platform
Starting a laser will perform an option similar to a [[Glossary#No Impact Land|No Impact Land]] making you actionable quicker than a waveland
## Standing Laser
Bad
## Full Hop Laser
Okay
## Short Hop Laser
Best
### Short Hop in Place/Short Hop Retreating
Good camping tool
### Short Hop Double Laser
Very frame tight, not worth the risk reward
# Ledge Options
Some of the hardest tech with Fox, not in execution, but for risk/reward. Most other characters have a decent and lenient ledge option, but Fox needs to use ledgedashing and platform wavelanding.
## Illusion on to stage
Mediocre move, only really should be used as a mixup
## Standard/Slow Get Up
Decent option, but can get punished
## Jump from ledge
Can be used to punish characters sitting too close and not reacting to this option
## Ledge Jump
It's an okay option, but most characters can F-Smash or another strong attack to punish it
### Ledge Jump to platform
An extension of ledge jump, this allows you to take a side platform instead of landing on stage.
#### Waveland/Laser Land on Platform
Similar to ledge jump with wavelanding/Laser Landing instead of standard landing
## Ledgedash
Should only be practiced after all the basic options (listed above) are mastered.
