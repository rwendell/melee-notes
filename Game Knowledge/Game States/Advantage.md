# Mid-Combo Reads
You need to read the DI of your opponent in order to find the optimal option here.  You should try to convert your combo into a landing trap or edgeguard opportunity if possible.
# Landing Traps
## Laser
Best/Safest option because it doesn't have a corresponding hitbox, allows for combo follow-ups.  Shoot a high laser that protects you.
## Up-Tilt and Short Hop Up-Air
Great for sharking opponents above you
# Edgeguards
## Double Jump Double Laser
Use this option after running off of the ledge to catch your opponents early double jump/recovery.
## Double Jump B-Air/D-Air from ledge
Use this option when an opponent is recovering close to the ledge to stuff out options 
## Laser F-Tilt/F-Smash
Use this when an opponent is trying to drift on to stage/sweet spot
