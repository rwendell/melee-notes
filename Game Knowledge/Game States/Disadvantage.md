# Out of Shield
## Full & Short Hop
### Full Hop
A great escape, unless they land directly on top of you.
### Short Hop
Shorter characters have a harder time dealing with this option than taller characters
## Roll
Rolling out of pressure is generally a good panic option
## Powershield Shine
Last case scenario if you don't have time to use other options
## Wavedash
Very fast option, you can get out and whiff punish pretty well. More vulnerable than roll.
## Spot Dodge
Okay in scrambles, use sparingly so it doesn't get read.
## Shield Grab
Situational. Good quick mix-up when you don't have time to short hop aerial or can't reach with shine.  
## Shield Drop
Pretty strong option, most often should be used with shine, but if you can't hit shine; aerials work too.
# Crouch Cancel
Falco has an *okay* crouch cancel, at low percents it can be good.  Falco doesn't have a good dash out of crouch cancel which hurts him.
## Shine
Good launcher after crouch cancel if you are not at knockdown percent
## F-Smash
Great at stopping bad getup attacks
# Recovery
Falco has one of the best short distance recoveries in the game. Side-b comes out fast, it should be the most used recovery
## Side-B
Should be your main recovery option.
## Up-B
Using at a height that allows you to go to platforms or sweet spot ledge is a good option if your opponents start reading your side-b recoveries.
## Shine Stall
Allows you to change your recovery timing. 
## Wall Jump
Situational mix-up. Similar to shine stall, gives extra height.  Can use an aerial out of wall jump to stop opponents from crowding the ledge.
## Air Dodge
Get past ledge chump checks (Marth f-tilt)
# Ledge Options
## Close to Ledge
### Ledgedash
really strong option, gets a lot of GALINT. A ledgedash into shine or up-tilt are work here
### Side-B & Aerial
Good as a call out, a bit more risky
## Far From Ledge
### Double Jump Double Laser
Great option, easy to mix up laser heights. Only countered by standing close to ledge, which loses to ledgedash.
