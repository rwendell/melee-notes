# Neutral
Use lasers to move around opponents range, watch what they do in response to laser.  This will always give you the first move. Properly spaced f-tilt on shield will help you keep your opponent at a safe range.
## Approach
### Approach Options
#### Laser
One of Falco's highest risk, but highest reward options.  Only use this when you have a read on your opponents movement.  If you catch them in a defensive option, you can get a massive punish afterwards with an aerial or a launcher. If you catch them in their shield, a good follow-up is a shine into shield pressure.
#### Late Aerial
You can only really use an approaching aerial if you know it will land safely, if not keep lasering. The safest option on shield is late aerials.
#### Shine
Similar to using an aerial to approach, you should only be using this when you know you can catch your opponent off-guard. 
### Shield Pressure Options
#### Grab
Safest and easiest, but with the weakest punish.  Normally better as a mix-up, but some matchups get great value from a grab.
#### Shine
Another very safe option, but you need to do this frame-perfect if you want to do it repeatedly.  Good for forcing out an option.
#### Fade back Aerial
This is good if they are shield grab happy, or they do laggy options out of shield.  After the fade back you can go for a big punish.
#### Wavedash
Similar to fade back aerial, but a bit more control on positioning
#### Aerial
Use this if the opponent doesn't move out of shield so you can keep chipping on shield damage and eventually get a shield poke to start a combo.
## Counter-Approach
### Early Aerials
You can use early aerials to snuff out an opponents jumps or poorly spaced aerials.  This will often lead to combos of your own.
### U-tilt
up tilt is great for countering approaching aerials above you.  Falco has a very tall U-tilt so you should be able to over a lot of aerial approaches with this option
## Retreat
### Full Hop
If you are in an uncomfortable range, Falco can easily escape with full hop.  Be careful if the opponent is directly above you, they might hit you as you're rising up. Full hopping out of shield on improper shield pressure can often get you to safety.
### Roll
Sometimes this is the only option to escape.  This is good against opponents that like to approach above you.  Rolling early away from their approach is usually the best choice for these options.  Other times you can roll is when your shield is getting pressured unsafely.
### Run Away
Sometimes this option gets forgotten but you can just run away from a laggy approach and reset to neutral if you are not comfortable countering your opponents approach. While running away you can turnaround laser to return to a neutral state.
