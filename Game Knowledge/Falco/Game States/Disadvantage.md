# Out of Shield
## Up Smash
Very strong option to punish laggy moves
## Full & Short Hop
### Full Hop
A great escape, unless they land directly on top of you.
### Short Hop
Shorter characters have a harder time dealing with this option than taller characters
## Roll
Rolling out of pressure is generally a good panic option
## Powershield Shine
Last case scenario if you don't have time to use other options
## Wavedash
Very fast option, you can get out and whiff punish pretty well. More vulnerable than roll.
## Spot Dodge
Okay in scrambles, use sparingly so it doesn't get read.
## Shield Grab
Great when you know you can grab, okay when there's a chance to get poked
## Shield Drop
Pretty strong option, most often should be used with b-air; other mixups: shine, nair, dair
# Crouch Cancel
Fox has a good crouch cancel, especially dash out of CC into up smash
## Shine
Good get off me tool or combo starter
## Up-Smash
Great at combo starting and punishing lazy approaches
## Grab
# Recovery
## Side-B
Should be your main recovery option.
## Up-B
Using at a height that allows you to go to platforms or sweet spot ledge is a good option if your opponents start reading your side-b recoveries.
## Shine Stall
Allows you to change your recovery timing. 
## Wall Jump
Situational mix-up. Similar to shine stall, gives extra height.  Can use an aerial out of wall jump to stop opponents from crowding the ledge.
## Air Dodge
Get past ledge chump checks (Marth f-tilt)
# Ledge Options
## Close to Ledge
### Ledgedash
really strong option, gets a lot of GALINT. A ledgedash into shine or up-smash work here
### Side-B & Aerial
Good as a call out, a bit more risky
## Far From Ledge
### Waveland on platform
