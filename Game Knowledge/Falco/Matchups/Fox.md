# Technical Data
# Approach Options
Falco should never approach Fox until they are conditioned into a knowing that you can keep them at bay with lasers. Once you have them playing your game you can start weaving in approach options.  Fox will start delaying moves which will help you get in.
## Laser Counter-Counter-Approach
Often times Fox will try to tank/shield your laser and counter it with an instant follow-up move.  Waiting out your approach to see what they are going to do will allow you to punish their counter-approach
## Full Hop Shine
Once you realize they will full hop approach, you can use this to punish fox during his rising state because he will not have a hitbox out. 
# Defense Tactics
You want to focus on zoning Fox with lasers which will get them to approach. When Fox starts to approach, and he goes above you, you should disengage.  Once he is slowed down and cannot approach from above, Fox will start doing options you can punish.
## Up-Tilt
if Fox is still full hopping onto you a lot you can start to punish with uptilt if you time the fast-fall timing properly.
# Common Interactions
## Reversals
You can get reversals more often than in other matchups. Slide-off shine, spot dodge shine, down-air reversals all work well at reversing the advantage state of Fox.
