# Early Percent (0-10)
Falco has a tougher time combing at lower percents.  You should laser them until 8-10% in order to get combos more reliably.  Shine can also work in some situations.

# Low-Mid Percent (10-60)
Pillaring is king here.  Shine/U-tilt into D-air bread and butter combos until they get knocked too high up to continue.

# Late Percent (60+)
Above 60% pillar combos stop working reliably so you need to rely on a more thorough combo game relying on mixups and reads to convert your advantage position into a kill. Back air is an extremely good tool at these percents, but this will mostly be matchup dependent.
