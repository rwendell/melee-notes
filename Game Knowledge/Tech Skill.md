# Lasers
Probably the most important tool Falco has in his kit. You want to be shooting them at max speed (frame 1 OOLag).  Make sure you're moving around so opponents don't get a read on you.  Dash back, Dash in, Empty hop, Platform Laser, Jump off platform laser etc. are good options for mixing up movement.
