# Recovery
Falco has one of the best short distance recoveries in the game. Side-b comes out fast, it should be the most used recovery
## Side-B

## Up-B
Using at a height that allows you to go to platforms or sweet spot ledge is a good option if your opponents start reading your side-b recoveries.
